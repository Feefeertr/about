From James Ramsay (GitLab PM):

> An issue that's probably relevant for collaboration for future phases of integration would likely be https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/50299 or similar, so that you have simple API interfaces to deal with rather than injecting UI elements via a browser extension.
