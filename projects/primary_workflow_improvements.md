# Primary workflow user experience improvements

Sourcegraph has added [a lot of new features](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog) lately, but we haven't neglected the existing features. We've fixed several core user experience issues:

- The close button in the panel header stays located on the top [Panel header close button fix](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/406)
- The Phabricator icon is now displayed correctly [Display Phabricator Icon correctly](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/340)
- If the user adds a filter duplicate, their choice of filter name will be shown on the filter chip [user prioritized filter chip name](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/348)
- View on GitHub button now links to the right branch and commit range [Link to the right branch and commit range on GitHub](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/294)

You might call this our version of [Project Paper Cuts](https://blog.github.com/2018-08-28-announcing-paper-cuts/)!
