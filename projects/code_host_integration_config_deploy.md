# Better configuration and deployment for Sourcegraph for your code host

We want to make it easier for site admins to configure and deploy the Sourcegraph browser extension and code host integrations for all their users. This is one of the most used features, but site admins previously have had no way of knowing who is using it, no way of rolling it out to everyone and no way of knowing what code hosts it works on.

Weâ€™ve added five new features:

1. A simplified UI and UX for browser extension configuration
1. A page showing which users are using it
1. A page showing which code hosts it works on
1. A way for site admins to notify users to install it on their instance or via team chat
1. A way for site admins to install it for everyone via G Suite
