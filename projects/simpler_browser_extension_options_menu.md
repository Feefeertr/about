# Simpler browser extension options menu

We've simplified the options menu in the [Sourcegraph browser extension](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/integration/browser_extension) for Chrome and Firefox. It's down to a single menu that you can open by clicking on the extension icon in your browser toolbar (or by visiting your browser's extension settings, if you hide the toolbar icon).

All you need to do is point it at your Sourcegraph instance (or https://sourcegraph.com for public code), and it'll add code intelligence to your code host. If you visit a new code host (such as a self-hosted GitHub Enterprise or GitLab), just click on the extension icon to be prompted to authorize the extension to run on that domain.

Here's what it looks like:
