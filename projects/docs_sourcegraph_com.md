# Documentation on docs.sourcegraph.com

[Sourcegraph documentation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com) has moved to [docs.sourcegraph.com](https://docs.sourcegraph.com) (from `about.sourcegraph.com/docs`). It's faster to navigate and more up-to-date (because it's now generated from [documentation sources in the open-source Sourcegraph repository](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24%40master+f:%5Edoc/+lang:markdown) instead of from a separate docs repository).

On Sourcegraph versions 2.13 and later (released in November 2018), you can also access the full documentation for your current version at the `/help` URL on your Sourcegraph instance.

In addition to all existing product and technical documentation, it has some new pages you might find interesting:

- [Sourcegraph roadmap](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/roadmap) with our future product plans
- [Development documentation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev) describing the architecture and implementation of Sourcegraph
