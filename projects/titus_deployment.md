# Deploying Sourcegraph to a Titus cluster

[Titus](https://netflix.github.io/titus/) is a container management platform from [Netflix](https://netflix.com)

We've added Titus as the 3rd deployment target for Sourcegraph, in addition to the [single-node Docker container deployment](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install/docker) and [Kubernetes cluster deployment](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install/kubernetes_cluster) targets.
