## Code browsing
View open source code, like gorilla/mux, on sourcegraph.com, or deploy your own instance to see public code alongside your private code. See how your codebase changes over time in by browsing through branches, commits, and diffs.

##Advanced code intelligence
Code intelligence makes browsing code easier, with IDE-like hovers, go-to-definition, and find-references on your code, powered by language servers based on the open-source Language Server Protocol.
## Hover tooltip
Use the hovertooltip to discover and understand your code faster. Click on a token and then go to it's definition, other refrences, or implementations. Speed through reviews by understanding new code and changed code and what it affects.

Code intelligence is powered by language servers based on the open-standard Language Server Protocol (published by Microsoft, with participation from Facebook, Google, Sourcegraph, GitHub, RedHat, Twitter, Salesforce, Eclipse, and others). Visit langserver.org to learn more about the Language Server Protocol, find the latest support for your favorite language, and get involved.
